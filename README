BOSTree -- An order statistic, self-balancing AVL tree implementation in C

An order statistic tree is a tree structure with two additional methods,
rank(node) and select(index), which allow array-like access in O(log n) time.
The idea is to simply store, for each node, the number of child-nodes.

I did not find a reference implementation for such a tree, so I wrote one
myself. Right now, the code is not fully optimized yet, id est does some
unnecessary rebalancing checks. The tests in main.c also need to be extended.
Also, some not strictly necessary numbers are stored, such as the number of
sub-nodes of the right child of a node. This allows to calculate the overall
count quickly, but can be removed to make the structure's overhead smaller.
